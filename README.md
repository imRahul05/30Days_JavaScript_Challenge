## JavaScript Concepts

### Variables

Variables are used to store data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`.

- `var`: Function-scoped or globally-scoped variable.
- `let`: Block-scoped variable.
- `const`: Block-scoped variable that cannot be reassigned.

#### Example

```javascript
var name = "John";
let age = 30;
const isStudent = true;
